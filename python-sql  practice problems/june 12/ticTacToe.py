"""In this Python challenge, write a function thatâ€™ll accept
two numbers. These numbers will represent a position on a tic-tac-toe board.
They can be 0 through 8,where 0 is the top-left spot, and 8 is the bottom-right spot.
These parameters are two marks on the tic-tac-toe board.
The function should return the number of the spot that can block these
two spots from winning the game."""
